# Spotify Clone

## Installation
Clone the repo and open it in your favourite text editor

Before running the project, delete both the yarn.lock files from client and server folders.

Then you have to install all the node files for the client:
```bash
cd client
npm install
```
Do the same thing for server:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```
